My config ðŸ˜Š

I'm Dutch so entity names are mostly in Dutch, entity_id's as well mostly, but I might change that in the future.
Everything displayed on the dashboard is Dutch.

I'm working on translating all the other stuff, scripts and automations and template sensors are mostly done.
If you want to know something more, just let me know ðŸ˜Ž

Nothing fancy in the Dashboard section, just basic stuff

# Buy me a coffee
If you think I deserve a coffe, please feel free to buy me one (I might spend it on another beverage though).
In case you decide to do so, thanks a lot!
