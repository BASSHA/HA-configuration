My config ðŸ˜Š

I'm Dutch so entity names are mostly in Dutch, entity_id's as well mostly, but I might change that in the future.
Everything displayed on the dashboard is Dutch.

I'm working on translating all the other stuff, scripts and automations are mostly done.
Script entity_id's not yet, because I have to make sure everything remains in working state

Nothing fancy in de Lovelace section, just basic stuff

What is maybe of more interest:
* [Script to resume Google Home stream after a TTS](https://github.com/TheFes/HA-configuration/blob/main/include/script/algemeen/google_home_say.yaml)
* [Script to send a TTS to a specific Google Home based on a voice command](https://github.com/TheFes/HA-configuration/blob/main/include/script/algemeen/google_home_say_voice.yaml)
